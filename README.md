# DynamicLinqCore
Create linq queries dynamically via strings.

Early beta.

This project should provide a way to create entity framework core queries from strings.

It should solve the most common issues you have when querying the database for showing data in tables:

- Filtering with Where
- Loading relations with Include and ThenInclude
- Loading a certain range of entities with Skip and Take
- Providing database ordering via OrderBy, ThenBy, etc.
